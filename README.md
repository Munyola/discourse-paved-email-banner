3. If you have styled your Discourse emails, you will need to turn off our 'Automatically Include in Emails' setting and insert our banner manually in to your emails using ```[paved_email_banner]```. You can edit these email templates in your Discourse Admin Panel under Customize > Email Templates.

That's it! We'll automatically populate the banner in your email sends.
